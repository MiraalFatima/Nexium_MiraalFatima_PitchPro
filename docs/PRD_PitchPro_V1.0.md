## 1. 🎯 Problem Statement

Crafting a compelling pitch — whether for a startup, product, idea, or job — is a challenge for non-writers and professionals alike. Most people struggle to structure their thoughts into persuasive content, especially under time pressure or in multiple languages. There is a lack of smart, automated, and easy-to-use tools to generate pitch content dynamically based on the user’s goals and context.

## 2. 💡 Solution Overview

**Pitch Pro** is a web-based AI-powered tool that helps users instantly generate high-quality pitch content by simply filling out a guided form. The tool supports:
- Multiple pitch types
- Language translation (English ↔ Urdu)
- Summarization for short versions
- Easy export as PDF

It integrates with AI models (via n8n + OpenRouter) and uses Supabase for authentication and pitch storage, with a futuristic UI built using Next.js and ShadCN.
